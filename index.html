output as a music producer and a performer.</p>
                                <p>

<h3>A Give And Take Philosophy</h3>
                                 <p>At Resonance we give students the ability to write music early into the course. They

learn to edit audio and create re-mixes right off the bat. We build a strong foundation for

their music with emphasis on structure and style.

We help them sculpt raw sounds and create a musical signature and identity. They will

learn to perfect their music with clean mixes .

This EMP Course is facilitated by a faculty renowned in the Indian EDM circuit, Mr. Guru

Prasad who has his own record label titled &quot;Since 16 Music&quot;. His musical work has been

curated and supported by World renowned Dj Sander Van Doom and has gotten airplay

by the resident DJs of the &quot;Ministry of Sound&quot; Collective

We limit each batch to a maximum of 6. Small sized batches will ensure clear

communication, interaction and feedback between the teacher and the student. This

also allows for a casual yet focused environment that is most conducive for learning. 

We also believe in the philosophy that &quot;IMPLEMENTED Knowledge is power&quot;. So

therefore, we strongly encourage you to follow up whatever is taught in class back at

home so that, in essence, brings about the true potential of learning by doing.</p>

								<p>Johnny Deep's music journey began back in 1985 when he fell in love with the new house music sounds emerging on the UK shores from Chicago. 

A few years later he acquired his first turntables and in 1992 at the tender age of 18 he debuted with his first regular radio slot on FM99.3 in Sydney where he had recently relocated from the UK . His show was well received but his most regular callers were other much older radio jockeys wondering where on earth this young kid was acquiring such unique music. 

Johnny has gone on to host more than 3000 radio shows on 8 different radio stations in his career with his big break coming when he was acquired to be exclusive RJ for The Ministry of Sound Australia. More recently he was offered a contract to become Smirnoff India's exclusive RJ and his shows can still be enjoyed at Smirnoff.in</p>
